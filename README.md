# SI507-HW04-gofish-xincli--This is a repository for HW4 Extra Credit assignment Winter 2018 SI507 class at UMich.


# Requirement:
For the first extra credit, you are going to implement a simple version of the classic card game Go Fish with a partner.  You will need to create a new repo on Github called SI507-HW04-gofish-(uniquename) containing a file named go_fish.py (which you will later submit on canvas).  For the first extra credit, you will simply create a version of the game which asks for input from two human players taking turns (no computer players will be involved).

The goal of this part of the exercise is to familiarize yourself with collaborative coding and also give you some more experience/practice with concepts you have learned earlier in the semester. (HINT: Feel free to use your Card, Deck, and Hand classes from Homework 2).
